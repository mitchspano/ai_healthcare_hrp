Let’s start by laying a solid foundation in small, verifiable increments. Here’s the order I’d recommend—and how to smoke-test each piece as you go:

---

## 1. Config & Environment (`src/config.py`)

**What to do:**

* Create a `Settings` class (Pydantic `BaseSettings`) that reads:

  * `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  * `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` (for CORS)
  * Any simulator or data paths you’ll need down the road.

**How to test:**

1. Write a tiny script or REPL snippet in the repo root:

   ```python
   from src.config import settings
   print(settings.openai_api_key, settings.frontend_origin)
   ```
2. Run `python -c "…"`, confirm it picks up values from your `.env`.

---

## 2. Schemas (`src/models/schemas.py`)

**What to do:**

* Define `ChatRequest(subject_id: str, text: str)`
* Define `ChatResponse(reply: str, tool_used: Optional[str], tool_result: Optional[Any])`

**How to test:**

```python
from src.models.schemas import ChatRequest
ChatRequest(subject_id="Subject 9", text="hi")  # should succeed
ChatRequest(text="no subject")                  # should raise a ValidationError
```

---

## 3. Tool Stubs (`src/services/tools.py`)

**What to do:**

* Copy in your `get_latest_metrics(...)` and `send_alert(...)` stubs.
* Have them return deterministic dummy data.

**How to test:**

* In a REPL or small script:

  ```python
  from src.services.tools import get_latest_metrics
  assert get_latest_metrics("Subject 9")["avg_bg"] == 140.2  # or whatever your stub does
  ```

---

## 4. Agent Logic (`src/services/agent.py`)

**What to do:**

* Import the Agents SDK (`openai-agents`).
* Wrap your stubs with `@function_tool`.
* Define the `Agent(...)` with instructions + tools.
* Write `run_agent(subject_id, user_text)` that invokes the SDK’s `Runner`.

**How to test:**

* In `tests/test_agent.py`, mock out your tools & the SDK client to return a canned LLM response.
* Assert that `run_agent(...)` returns the expected `reply` and that the right tool got “called.”

---

## 5. FastAPI Router (`src/routers/chat.py`)

**What to do:**

* Create an `APIRouter()` with `POST /chat` wired to call your `run_agent()`.
* Raise `HTTPException` on errors.

**How to test:**

* Write `tests/test_chat.py` using FastAPI’s

  ```python
  from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
  from src.main_agent import app

  client = TestClient(app)
  resp = client.post("/chat", json={"subject_id":"Subject 9","text":"hello"})
  assert resp.status_code == 200
  assert "reply" in resp.json()
  ```
* This gives you end-to-end coverage of request validation, agent invocation, and response shape.

---

## 6. Bootstrap the App (`src/main_agent.py`)

**What to do:**

* Instantiate `FastAPI()`, add CORS with your `settings.frontend_origin`, and include your chat router under `/chat`.

**How to test:**

* Run via

  ```bash
  uvicorn src.main_agent:app --reload --port 8000
  ```
* Hit `http://localhost:8000/docs` in the browser—Swagger UI should list your `/chat` endpoint.

---

## 7. Integration Smoke Test

1. **React Front-End**

   * Start `npm run dev` in `t1d-chat-ui`.
   * Confirm it POSTs to `http://localhost:8000/chat`.

2. **Manual Curl**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"subject_id":"Subject 9","text":"How am I?"}'
   ```

3. **End-to-End**

   * Type a message in your React UI → see the agent reply.

---

### Recap

By tackling each slice **in isolation** and testing it before moving on, you’ll build confidence that:

* Your settings load correctly.
* Your Pydantic schemas enforce the contract.
* Your tools work as expected.
* Your agent logic integrates cleanly with the SDK.
* Your FastAPI router and app stand up without errors.
* The full loop—React → FastAPI → Agents SDK → React—actually runs.

Let me know which of these you’d like to start on, or if you want sample code for any particular file!
