# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a comprehensive data processing pipeline to train an LSTM neural network for predicting blood sugar levels using the AZT1D (A Real-World Dataset for Type 1 Diabetes) dataset. The pipeline will handle data acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to create a robust blood glucose prediction system that can assist in diabetes management.

## Requirements

2. WHEN the download is complete THEN the system SHALL extract the ZIP file contents to a designated data directory
3. IF the dataset already exists locally THEN the system SHALL check for updates and only re-download if necessary
4. WHEN extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to load and validate the AZT1D dataset structure, so that I can ensure data integrity before processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to create time-series sequences from the diabetes data, so that I can train an LSTM model to predict future blood glucose levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating sequences THEN the system SHALL generate input sequences of configurable length (default 60 minutes) with target glucose values
2. WHEN processing multiple participants THEN the system SHALL maintain participant boundaries and not mix sequences across individuals
3. WHEN handling irregular timestamps THEN the system SHALL interpolate or resample data to create uniform time intervals
4. WHEN sequences are created THEN the system SHALL split data into training, validation, and test sets with proper temporal ordering

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to build and configure an LSTM neural network architecture, so that I can train a model optimized for blood glucose prediction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the model THEN the system SHALL create a configurable LSTM architecture with adjustable layers, units, and dropout rates
2. WHEN configuring the model THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate loss functions for regression tasks (MAE, MSE, or custom glucose-specific metrics)
3. WHEN setting up training THEN the system SHALL include early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and model checkpointing
4. WHEN the architecture is defined THEN the system SHALL provide model summary and parameter count information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to train the LSTM model with proper validation and monitoring, so that I can ensure the model learns effectively without overfitting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training begins THEN the system SHALL implement k-fold cross-validation or time-series specific validation strategies
2. WHEN monitoring training THEN the system SHALL track and log training/validation loss, accuracy metrics, and glucose-specific metrics (MARD, time-in-range prediction accuracy)
3. WHEN overfitting is detected THEN the system SHALL apply early stopping and save the best model checkpoint
4. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive training reports with loss curves and performance metrics

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a healthcare researcher, I want to evaluate the trained model using clinically relevant metrics, so that I can assess its potential utility in diabetes management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating the model THEN the system SHALL calculate Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) for glucose predictions
2. WHEN assessing clinical utility THEN the system SHALL compute Clarke Error Grid Analysis and Parkes Error Grid Analysis
3. WHEN analyzing predictions THEN the system SHALL evaluate time-in-range prediction accuracy and hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia detection rates
4. WHEN evaluation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate detailed performance reports with visualizations and clinical interpretation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to save and version the trained model and preprocessing components, so that I can deploy and reproduce the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training is successful THEN the system SHALL save the trained LSTM model in a standard format (TensorFlow SavedModel or PyTorch)
2. WHEN saving preprocessing components THEN the system SHALL serialize scalers, encoders, and feature engineering pipelines
3. WHEN versioning models THEN the system SHALL include metadata about training data, hyperparameters, and performance metrics
4. WHEN models are saved THEN the system SHALL provide easy loading mechanisms for inference and further training
